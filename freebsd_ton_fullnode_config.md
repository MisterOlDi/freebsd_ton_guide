# FreeBSD Telegram Open Network full node configuration guide
## Configuration and initialization of TON full node
This guide outlines process of conifguration and initialization of full node / validator for Telegram Open Network based blockchain networks on FreeBSD host, based on example of [Newton Blockchain](https://github.com/newton-blockchain) Testnet.

Following this guide you should be able to spawn nodes for other networks as well, even on the same machine / virtual host if you desire.

## Prerequesites / assumptions
Completion of chapter 1 of [FreeBSD Telegram Open Network installation guide](./freebsd_ton_installation.md) and as a result:

* Compiled and installed distribution under `/usr/local/opt/ton`
* Presence of `/var/db/ton` data directory
* Access to internet from the host

We also assume that you chose to create a dedicated user called *tond* and this user has read/write access to `/var/db/ton` directory. You can substitute this username for any other user, just make sure that this account can access `/var/db/ton`.


## Chapter 1: Create work directory for your node
In our example node work directory will be named: `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node`. 

> sudo -u tond mkdir -p /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/{etc,db,log}\
sudo -u tond chmod -R 700 /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node

This should work if you have a user *tond* and this user has r/w rights to `/var/db/ton`

### Result
We have created a work directory for our ton node.

## Chapter 2: Download global network configuration
Configuration of each TON node begins with downloading of *global configuration* file for your network.
This file contains some basic information about network, for example it specifies at least one node with fixed IP address from which ton software can download additional network information.

Each network (Newton testnet, TFC testnet, TON testnet2, Freeton etc.) has it's own *global configuration* file. Source of those files depends on the network. We will be using [Newton Blockchain testnet global configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newton-blockchain/newton-blockchain.github.io/master/newton-test.global.config.json):

> sudo -u tond fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newton-blockchain/newton-blockchain.github.io/master/newton-test.global.config.json -o /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/etc/global_config.json

After this file you should have a file `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/etc/global_config.json` with some data in it. Please do not edit this file, there is nothing what you as node operator need to change there.

### Result
We have downloaded global configuration file for our node, now we can generate *local configuration*.

## Chapter 3: Initialize local configuration
Next step is to create *local configuration* using *global configuration* file downloaded in previous step.

> sudo -u tond /usr/local/opt/ton/bin/validator-engine --global-config /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/etc/global_config.json --db /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db --ip ***IP:PORT*** --logname /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/log/init.log

Replace ***IP*** and ***PORT*** with fixed public IP of your node and PORT number of your choice, I would advise to use high port number beginning from 20000. 

This command will run and exit without any output but if execution was success then local configuration file `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/config.json` would be generated. If the file is not there then something went wrong, check *log files*.

***Important***: Please note that the command used here is pretty much identical to the one that is used to run actual node. If the *local configuration* file already exists then you will start a node. (command will not exit automatically). This is not a problem, just break it off (ctrl_c).

### Result
We have generated a *local configuration* file `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/config.json` for our node. This file contains quite a few things: our IP address, network port, generated adnl address etc. This is the holy grail of our node.

Essentially, this is it: your machine can operate as a network node, you can try and start it by running:

> sudo -u tond /usr/local/opt/ton/bin/validator-engine --global-config /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/etc/global_config.json --db /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db --logname  /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/log/node.log

If all went well then this command should stay in foreground as long as you do not kill it. 

#### But does it work?
Well, if process stays in foreground and does not exit immediately then this is already good news. You really need to check [log files](#chapter-4-node-log-files) to see what is going on. There can be many messages, please see [common node errors](./freebsd_ton_faq.md#common-node-error-messages) section of FAQ for some of the most common ones.

Depending on the state of the net you are trying to connect to it can take quite a while to even find state, let alone sync. It can easily take **days** for a full node to completely sync even on fastest internet line with very quick hardware.

Here are some other indications (besides logs) that your node does something:
* *validator-engine* process uses CPU: anything over 20% of a single core on a modern CPU means that your node is doing something and not just idling.
* Node generates network traffic: Anything over 1mbps of summetric up/down UDP traffic means that something is going on.
* *database directory* (`/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db` in our case) is growing.

### Automate the node
It is at this step that I advise you to automate start/stop of the node as a system service, I strongly advise to utilize *daemontools* do do that, please consult [Chapter 2 of FreeBSD Telegram Open Network installation guide](./freebsd_ton_installation.md#chapter-2-running-node).

## Chapter 4: Node log files
It is important to understand architecture of *validator-engine* in order to understand log file structure: *validator-engine* acts as a **main process** that takes the command arguments, loads configs and then spawns **children processes / threads** that do actual job. Each process / thread writes into *it's own log file*.

The log file you specify with `--logname` parameter points to log file used by **main process**, each **thread** writes it's own log file that has `.threadN.log` appended to name of main log file. Where N is number of the thread.

As a result, during initiation two logs will be made:

* `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/log/init.log` that ideally should be empty
* `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/log/init.log.thread1.log` that will contain information from the thread that actually made the *local configuration*

## Chapter 5: Configuring node cli client-server
### Why CLI client
**[TODO]** Describe what the client is used for.

### Prerequesites / assumptions
1. Completion of chapters 1-3 of this guide with the result of working node.
2. Ability to [control the node](./freebsd_ton_installation.md#chapter-2-running-node) using *daemontools* 

We also assume that you chose to create a dedicated user *tond* and initialized the configuration using that user.

### Architecture
#### Transport
CLI functionality is client-server architecture where role of the client is played by binary *validator-engine-console* and server is the same *validator-engine* process that runs the node.

#### Security
Security is based on PKI architecture by utilizing private/public key pairs for both server and clients. Thus, the absolute minimum configuration requires generation of two keypairs: one for the server and another for the client.

### Step 1: generation and installation of PKI keypairs
Please see [Generation of PKI keypairs for TON](#generation-of-pki-keypairs-for-ton) for general information on how keypairs are generated.

#### Server
Change into your home directory and execute:
> /usr/local/opt/ton/bin/generate-random-id --mode keys --name newton-testnet-node-server

Record the *Hex* and *Base64* representations of generated public key. please see [Generation of PKI keypairs for TON](#generation-of-pki-keypairs-for-ton) for more info.

Install the server *private key file* into *keyring* storage of the node instance:
> sudo mv newton-testnet-node-server /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/keyring/***Hex_public_key***\
sudo chown tond:ton /var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/keyring/***Hex_public_key***

***Please make sure to insert proper Hex public key representation into the command above.***

Server *public key file* `newton-testnet-node-server.pub` will be used by *validator-engine-console* and hense should be placed on where it is accesible by *validator-engine-console* (possibly other machines).

#### Client
Change into your home directory and execute:
> /usr/local/opt/ton/bin/generate-random-id --mode keys --name newton-testnet-node-client

Record the *Hex* and *Base64* representations of generated public key. please see [Generation of PKI keypairs for TON](#acme) for more info.

Client *private key file* `newton-testnet-node-client` will be used by *validator-engine-console* and hense should be placed on where it is accesible by *validator-engine-console* (possibly other machines).

### Step 2: configuration of CLI server in the node
In this step we will tell our node that it should start cli listener, to do so we need to edit *local configuration* file `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/config.json` and restart the node.

***Attention:*** Please backup your local configuration file before changing it.

We need to insert a new CLI server definition into *control* block of *local configuration* file. The definition looks as following json structure:
`
  { "id" : "***Base64 Server Public Key***",
    "port" : ***CLI Console Port***,
    "allowed" : [
      { "id" : "***Base64 Client Public Key***",
        "permissions" : 15
      }
    ]
  }
`

***Attention***: Please make sure to insert proper ***Base64***(!!) public key representations into the structure above. Also set a port on which to listen for cli connections.

Open the file `/var/db/ton/newton-testnet-node/db/config.json` in editor and insert this definition into *control* block, here is the final result with ***dummy example values which will be different in your case***:
`
  { "id" : "tnEgKFgGj/afHDEzAJR3patE1ksJ7Ocowy6TLqm/aSA=",
    "port" : 12200,
    "allowed" : [
      { "id" : "KRP3bJdzUb8/sZvUun5LYerlIe4ET5tVQXFdW8iQECg=",
        "permissions" : 15
      }
    ]
  }
`

**TODO**

## Chapter 7: mytonctl
**TODO**

# Generation of PKI keypairs for TON 
PKI keypars for ton are generated using `/usr/local/opt/ton/bin/generate-random-id` executable, each generation results in two files and two strings:
* *Private key file* and *Public key file*
* *Hex public key representation* and *Base64 public key representation* those strings contain the same information as *Public key file*, just in a different encoding.

`/usr/local/opt/ton/bin/generate-random-id` takes two arguments: 
* `--mode keys` that tells that we wish to generate a new PKI keypair.
* `--name` that tells under which name to save the output. This can be any string.

## Generate the key
Change into your home directory and execute:
> /usr/local/opt/ton/bin/generate-random-id --mode keys --name acme

This comand will output a single line with two strings, it will look something like:
> `F20F63AFEF12926D0B0A023C8AA8217BDFF731E60EEE236D3D21C535E7F88F9C 8g9jr+8Skm0LCgI8iqghe9/3MeYO7iNtPSHFNef4j5w=` 

but of course your strings will be different.

The first string `F20F63AFEF12926D0B0A023C8AA8217BDFF731E60EEE236D3D21C535E7F88F9C` is *Hex public key representation*, second string `8g9jr+8Skm0LCgI8iqghe9/3MeYO7iNtPSHFNef4j5w=` is *Base64 public key representation*. **Please record this information as we will need it later**

You will also find two files in your directory: `acme` which is a *Private key file* and `acme.pub` which is a *Public key file*.

**[TODO]**: Can Base64 and Hex representations be recreated from public key file? How?
